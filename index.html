        <h2>About</h2>
    </section>
        <p>My name is Seth Johnson, and I am a dedicated mental health professional with experience in trauma, dissociative identity disorders, and cognitive restructuring. At 40 years old, 
            I firmly believe in the power of perseverance and the potential to achieve any goal through focused determination.
            <br>My passion for software development has grown into an obsession, driven by the endless possibilities it offers for creativity, transformation, and innovationâ€”all 
            from the convenience of my computer. While I prefer to keep my personal vision private, I am committed to making a meaningful impact through my faith in God and 
            the relationships He enables me to cultivate over time.
        </p>
